Welcome to the landing page of a fictional energy company. The company distributes three flagship products:

1. Solara (solar energy)
2. Windstream (wind energy)
3. Aquapure (hydro energy)

All product models and textures have been crafted and uv unwrapped using Blender, ensuring seamless integration into three.js. In addition to the page's modern design, I have incorporated simple animations and water shaders to enhance the water simulation experience.


The design is optimized for following screen sizes:
- Laptop: 1455px Ã— 802px
- Phones: Width ranging from 320px to 500px


Please be aware that the project has no optimizations, such as image compression, for optimal page speed.
