Welcome to the landing page of a fictional energy company. The company boasts three flagship products:

1. Solara (solar energy)
2. Windstream (wind energy)
3. Aquapure (hydro energy)

All product models and textures have been meticulously crafted uv unwrapper using Blender, ensuring seamless integration into three.js. In addition to the page's modern design, I have incorporated simple animations and water shaders to enhance the water simulation experience.
